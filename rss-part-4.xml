&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Sunrise: September 3, 2003     Sunset: June 23, 2020&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img src="https://le-cdn.hibuwebsites.com/8c206443bcac4e52b0246f97e1431abe/dms3rep/multi/opt/Screen+Shot+2020-07-13+at+4.15.10+PM-1920w.png" alt="obit image" /&gt;
&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Navaeh Emoni Smith, age 16, passed away on June 23rd, 2020 in Colorado Springs, CO. She was born on September 9th, 2003 to Johneshia Smith, Kyonte Lock Sr and Corey Dunlap Sr. in Las Vegas,NV. From the moment Navaeh blessed this earth with her presence would automatically be known and felt. Her beautiful smile and dimples made it nearly impossible to have a bad day around her. Her laughter was one of a kind, contagious, and you could literally hear it from a mile away. Dancing and singing was Navaeh's passion. She would walk around all day, singing her favorite songs and posting Tic Toks while showing off her dance moves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navaeh was recently accepted in the Zeta Archonettes-Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc. sisterhood and was really proud of her accomplishments. To say she will be missed is an absolute understatement ! To be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. Although it is painful to accept, Navaeh's mind is now at peace and she is  now in a better place. One day we will all reach our day of judgement, but today Navaeh would love for you to live, smile breathe, and celebrate life. The goal isn't to live forever; the goal is to create something that will live forever. What Navaeh has created will be everlasting in the hearts and minds of those she touched. She may not physically be with us; however Navaeh's cries have been heard, and her tears were not in vain. The sound of those tears will build upon the legacy that she has created, and the seeds she planted within us all will grow endlessly. We hear you Baby Girl.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;William Lemar Ray, also known as Lee and Skii, passed away in Las Vegas, NV on June 11, 2020 Lee was born in riverside, California July 1, 1982 to Bruce Batiste and Valarie Ray Ward. He grew up in a very loving family that expanded from Riverside to Oakland and Las Vegas. He was an exceptional young man and loved being adventurous and playful. At the age of 3 he would run through the Ray family home after a bath with a towel tied around his neck like a cape thinking he was Superman. When he was 12, his curiosity drove him to constantly disassemble and reassemble electronic devices such as radios and appliances to discover how they functioned. After graduating high school, Lee began his journey as an adult weaving his way in the world of work. He dabbled in construction and eventually became an electrician. As he grew older, he continued to care for his family, always the friendly Superman in the room. He enjoyed music, fashion, dancing, and telling elaborate stories with his 'DeeBo' sarcasm and a devious smirk on his face. He was blessed by God to be a father figure to his first niece Nile and eventually welcomed 3 children, Omari, Jaylah and William Jr.&lt;br/&gt;As he grew older and larger, his size led him to take up Ninjutsu where he learned discipline and agility. He mastered this skill so well that he was invited to a Ninjutsu tournament where he met Steven Segal. Lee loved his little brother Derrick. He always protected him and made sure he knew he was the boss. He also spent many hours with his cousins as he treated them like brothers teaching them how to be tough and walk like a ninja. He loved the fiercest pit bull and the gentlest cat. He was able to train them with q snap of his finger or with his famous finger point. The gym was his second home. Many photos of him reveal his six pack under tight T-shirts. He loved to lift weights. It gave him peace and serenity and motivated others to work out and strong.&lt;br/&gt;Lee enjoyed and loved being with friends and family, especially his children. His love for all children in his life is evident in the outpouring of well wishes and tributes as they shared memories of him coming around; he was their Superman who came to play. Lee lived his last days saying goodbye to those he loved in his own way; very loving and unselfishly thinking of his mother, his children and his siblings He leaves for us to cherish, his essence, so powerful it surrounds us like the sky.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Dean Fernell Anderson was born on April 8, 1955, in Flint, Mi to the proud parents Clarence "CB" Anderson and Mamie E. Moore (Hall) and is the oldest of three from this union. He accepted Christ at an early age and considered himself a Baptist. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dean graduated from Flint Northwestern High School in 1973 and shortly after, he served in the United States Air Force as a Sergeant, a skilled carpenter, and also a boy scout leader, which isn't surprising since he loved kids. He was honorably discharged in 1979.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While stationed in Indian Springs, NV he later met the love of his life, Debra Faye (Spencer), in 1977 and she became his loyal loving wife on February 25, 1978, and Dean became a loving and devoted father to Rochelle. They remained happily married for 42 years until his passing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dean was a jack of all trades and worked many jobs after he retired from the Air Force. Bartending was his natural talent where he worked at Desert Inn and Silver City and was often referred to as ISAAC from the "Love Boat". He then became a cab driver, which he loved and driving while entertaining customers was second nature to him until his passing, although we truly believe he missed his calling as a comedian.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dean was always the life of the party. With his jokes and philosophies, there was never a dull moment. He was always up for having cocktails and trying new drinks. He was extremely kind, generous, happy, and full of joy with an infectious laugh that touched your spirit. Most importantly EVERYBODY loved and enjoyed his company, especially the nieces, nephews, and friends of the family.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Herbert Leon Nixon was born on June 1, 1964 in Los Angeles, California to August and Helen Nixon. As early as eleven he was placed in the spotlight by The Young Saints Scholarship Foundation, a nonprofit youth organization in Los Angeles. Herbert debut solo vocal performance with The Young Saints was televised on a local network and there was not a dry eye backstage or in the audience. The skills and discipline he learned with The Young Saints, the woodcraft Rangers, piano and tennis lessons with his grandmother Dora Belle Ansley, and every other program she kept him involved in played a major role in his development as a young man. &lt;br/&gt;He attended Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California in the 10th grade  and joined the ROTC, we were certain he was headed for the military after graduation, but he had other plans. He was accepted to Birmingham High School, Van Nuys, California and immediately joined the marching band playing the bass and snare drum. Marching band was his whole world in high school along with his two best friends Ernest and Joe they were unstoppable. Herbert graduated from Birmingham High in 1982.&lt;br/&gt;He loved to play his drum in his room, build go-carts, and spend most of his time learning something new, or creating something new. Herbert had an "I can teach myself anything attitude". &lt;br/&gt;In the 90's Herbert legally changed his name to Okino Kegali Nixon to his dad he will always be "Drop" but we all know he called himself "Uncle Elroy".&lt;br/&gt;He obtained a California Real Estate License, a California Barber License, and Nevada HVAC Certification, he taught himself to speak spanish by listening to audio cassettes, and even took Helicopter flying lessons. He worked for Bank of America, Los Angeles, California and Los Angeles Unified School District prior to relocating to Las Vegas, Nevada.&lt;/div&gt;

He leaves to cherish his memories, daughter Jade Mayweather, son LehKei Mayweather and a bonus son Mike Cutright. Three sisters Anna (Sonny) Jacobs, Eloise (Lloydell) Harris and Jackie Mayweather, Life-Long friends and caregivers Otis Pimpleton Jr. and Boza Edwards, a host of nieces, and nephews, family and friends. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;He was preceded in death by his mother and father, sister Dorothy "Dot" Mayweather and brother Theartha "Thee" Mayweather&lt;br/&gt;As an adolescent Roger was always a feisty soul and little did anyone know his dominant personality coupled with his determination to not be mediocre would lead him to stardom.&lt;br/&gt;Roger begun boxing at the age of 16 and quickly begun to compete and excel in amateur bouts, Golden Gloves, state and national competitions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By the time he was 20, he moved to Las Vegas where he turned pro shortly thereafter. By age 21, he solidified his first boxing and the greats before him. He was quick to tell reporters and whomever challenged his boxing intellect, ''you don't know shit about boxing!" this quote will be forever etched in our memories and within the boxing community as a whole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although he retired his gloves in 1999, he picked up the hand pads and is acknowledged today as the best to ever do it. During his training career, he worked with many champions such as Oscar De La Hoya, Lailah Ali and his undefeated nephew Floyd Mayweather Jr. but he was just as passionate about training our youth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Roger was not in the gym, he was busy being a devoted father. His children meant the world to him. He literally shopped for them every day, packed lunches for school, attended his daughter tennis matches, played basketball with his son, took them to the movies, amusements parks and wherever their little hearts desired. Roger also enjoyed skating, shooting pool and giving back to the less fortunate. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;After a long bout of illness, our beloved Roger was called home on March 17, 2020. He fought a  good fight and will be missed dearly by his children, family, friends and the entire boxing community&lt;/div&gt;

He always said, "We worked in the cotton field half of the year and went to school the other half of the year."

He said, " I wanted to wait for my kids to finish school, before I went back to school.

Despite being a full-time Pastor, Pastor Henry steadily worked for 45years; 41 of those year were dedicated to working the 'grave-yard' shift at what's now called "Century Link Telecommunications." &lt;br/&gt;Pastor Henry retired from his illustrious career in January of 2019 to place all of his focus on his baby " New Paradise Missionary Baptist Church." Pastor Henry, developed numerous quotes and his most memorable quotes were: "It's in your Bible if you didn't tear it out and God is so big if he moved, he'd bump into himself." His most memorable quote for New Paradise was, Working Together Works!  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt; Pastor Henry was a very humble, kind, and hardworking man. His family was his proudest accomplishment who he boasted upon and loved dearly. His favorite work phrase was "if there is a job to do, stay with it until it's done." He will be remembered for his canny sense of humor, flawless love of people, and unwavering commitment to the Lord! &lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;Pastor Henry remained the Shepperd of the New Paradise Missionary Baptist Church until God saw fit to call him home, February 28, 2020, as he transitioned peacefully at his home, built for his wife and children.&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Orzine Renett Robinson was born on October 16, 1942 in the community of Dudley Lake, AR. to her parents Lee Tom Robinson Sr. and Annie Bea Robinson. Orzine received Christ at a very young age and it never left it never left her. She received her formal education at Wabbaseka High School. Orzine was united in Holy Matrimony to Melvin Thomas Jr. and to this union they had 3 children. Orzine was a loving mother and taught her children the values of life and love in family, friends and the love of Christ. Orzine moved from Arkansas to Chicago where she raised her children with the have and have not standards!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orzine also then pursued her career by moving to Los Angeles and the to Las Vegas, Nevada. Orzine worked for the Post Office in Chicago for 12 years before moving her family to Los Angeles, CA. While in California, she worked as a manager in House Keeping for the Western Bonaventure and this is where she found her passion; she was there for over 10 years. Orzine was offered an opportunity to come to Las Vegas in the early 1990's where she continues her second career as a manager for the Luxor; when another opportunity at the "New" Mandalay Bay Resort. She eagerly jumped at it in 1999. She was loved by everyone at the Mandalay Bay and was known as "Mama". (I don't believe that they really knew her name). But her kindness and generosity spoke for itself and she loved the Mandalay Bay with all of her heart and knew everyone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orzine retired at the age of 72 years old because she loved the people so much at the Bay, that she did not want to leave until her age caught up with her. After retiring, mom became a member of Mountaintop Faith Ministries. She loved her Pastor and First Lady so much she became a Senior Eagle and that was the proudest moment of her later life. Reading her word, ministering to others and bringing people to Mountaintop was her mission; she was on fire for the Lord. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orzine's hobbies were collecting bells from all over the country and is known to have collected over 1,700 bells!!! She loved playing cards, shopping at thrift stores, decorating, organizing and cleaning. She could spot dirt and dust as small as a mustard seed! And yes, it has to be cleaned immediately!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orzine loved her family with a passion like no other; when she retired, she was eager ready to visit them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Orzine will be missed for an eternity because of that smile, her generosity, love and kind spirit. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Franklyn Gerrard Verley III was born in New York, New York "Harlem USA" on December 27, 1960 to Franklyn Fitzgerald Verley II and Carroll Ann Howell Verley. From the beginning Franklyn was influence by his Jamaican grandparents both of the Howell's and the Verley's. The family sat around the table and told stories of life in Jamaica and the journey to New York. These stories instilled in him a strong commitment to family and community. Franklyn's parents and grandparents also impressed upon him an authentic appreciation of his roots through submerging him in black culture. Franklyn's father taught him how to be a strong black man who balanced education and self-discipline. His mother's love for educating young people inspired Franklyn's love for mentoring young minds. Growing up in Harlem during the 70's and 80's gave him a flair to his personality that only the community could. Franklyn build lifelong relationships that have sustained through the years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While growing up, Franklyn was a sports enthusiast, he excelled in wrestling and football. In 1985 Franklyn enlisted in the US Marine Corps. Franklyn later went to work for the New York Times. During his 19 years at The Times, he grew his career to become the regional head of distribution, covering all of New York State and surrounding areas. While at The Times, he cultivated even more lifelong friendships. Relationships that he credited as helping increase hi love for journalism and writing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After relocating to Las Vegas, Franklyn did what came naturally to him....&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Franklyn, aka "Verl" started working for the City of Las Vegas in the Parks &amp;amp; Recreation Division over 21 years ago. He acted as an advocate for his team, he is passionate about keeping the team inspired and motivated. And as with every place Frankly goes, he built lifelong friendships and impacted lives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wanting to connect the community and power of mass media back to its historical relevance in the Black community, he set his sights on radio and joined KCEP FM in June of 2000. His NY roots provided "Franklyn G" insights to Rap, Hip-Hop, New Jack swing, Disco, Soul, R&amp;amp;B and Jazz that shaped his style of programming and events. Franklyn developed his experience in various musical formats as part of the KCEP family, yet he was always hoping to create pathways to connect this small desert oasis to the larger Black diaspora though "Black Intelligent talk radio". In 2006, Franklyn developed "Like It Is Radio!" He used this outlet as an opportunity to speak truth to power and birth events such as "Kemet in The Desert", "Men Who Cook", "Emancipation Circle" and countless other community events. Franklyn is also a part of the renowned :Breakdown Crew". During his time in Las Vegas, Franklyn is the recipient of countless certificates, declarations and awards most recently including the Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame, Fountain of Hope Community Activism Award and NAACP Legacy Builder Award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Franklyn leaves a legacy wherever he goes, but this Desert has been impacted by his bold creative community involvement. Weather "F to the Jizzle". "Franklyn G", "Frank-o-domus" or "Student Verley," this city has been challenged to keep this important work alive. He will tell you "there is still work to be done!"&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[
&lt;h3&gt;Sunrise: January 9, 1966     Sunset: August 28, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="https://le-cdn.hibuwebsites.com/8c206443bcac4e52b0246f97e1431abe/dms3rep/multi/opt/Sharon+Harrell-1920w.PNG" alt="obit image" /&gt;
&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Sharon Gisele Harrell (1/9/66) was born and adopted in Las Vegas, NV, by her loving father, Thomas Charles "TC" Harrell (originally from Baton Rouge, LA) and mother, Marie-Claude Mertz (Harrell Ross; originally of France; 11/26/39-6/13/98). Sharon adored her parents and often referred to them with pride as the best parents anyone could possibly have. Soon after Sharon was adopted, TC was deployed to Vietnam, and Sharon and her mother, Marie-Claude, moved to France to live with Marie-Claude's family during his deployment. As a result, French was Sharon's first language, and it was the only language she knew until she returned with both of her parents to live in Las Vegas when she was 5 years old.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Around the age of 12, Sharon was told that she was adopted and that information was available about her birth parents if she ever wished to attempt to make contact. Being very content with her family life and with all the love and warmth from her extended family, she expressed no interest in reaching out until years later. In the meantime, Sharon graduated from Rancho High School in Las Vegas, and she learned all of the skills needed to become an expert in Food Prep and Food Services during her career at Caesars Palace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During Sharon's adolescent years, TC and Marie divorced, and Marie Claire married Timothy Ross. From this union, Sharon was thrilled and proud to gain her one and only sister, Ja'Lisea Ross, who now survives Sharon along with Ja'Lisea's three children, Gi'Ana Bolin, Jai'La McCree, and Jai'Len Hicks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1990, Sharon decided to search for and easily found her biological parents, Lorraine Noirot (4/5/42-2/16/08; from northern Michigan and of French descent) and Leroy "Roy" Frasier (7/6/37-12/29/17; of Brooklyn, NY; and wife, Gillian Bowen Frasier). Lorraine and Roy had met while working in the Peace Africa. Sharon's kind and generous spirit overflowed into the Frasier family and they returned her love with grateful hearts for her presence in their lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharon's mother's (Marie-Claude's) early passing in June 1998 was a great blow to Sharon, and she was determined to remain extremely close to TC and TC's family, especially after several of them came west to Las Vegas and California after Hurricane Katrina. While Sharon had always desired to be a school teacher and gradually completed her classwork to do so, she decided to open a restaurant in 2004 using a family recipe for barbeque sauce that dated back to 1902, and named the restaurant after her father, TC. Sharon was very proud of her father and her family, and she was thrilled to be able to offer employment to friends and family members when they needed it. Sharon was dedicated to maintaining a down-home personal feel that made her customers seem more like family. What was most important to her was what was always most important - family, community, and providing delicious food.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Business grew rapidly and then exploded after a 2007 restaurant reviewing in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Heidi Knapp Rinella, called TC's barbeque the best barbeque she had tasted in Las Vegas, in which she gave it perfect scores across the board and the following comment: "As for us, we'll invoke TC's motto: 'The way to a person's heart is through the ribs,'" she wrote.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a recent article, Sharon was quoted as saying, "It just feels good to know that you've touched someone, even if no one else knows about it. We just believe in doing the right thing and being good to people. My family is what inspires me. Family is everything. This restaurant is just an extension of that. You can't teach someone to care about people. It's part of who you are."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activism, fighting for equality, and helping people in need. That is not just what Sharon did, it was who she was. As a result. TC's World Famous Rib Crib participated in several community events over the years, including providing catering for the Las Vegas Boxing Hall of Fame and the Holy Smoke - Misfit Missionaries group, who help the homeless population living in the tunnels of Las Vegas. She consistently donated hundreds of burgers for the homeless on Sundays. In 2017, the restaurant provided dinner to a weary group of 70 players and staff of the Miami Central rockets high school football team was left stranded by Hurricane Irma in Las Vegas after playing a game against local high school, Bishop Gorman. While waiting for airports to reopen and communication with family members to be restored after the storm, TC's Rib Crib stepped in to provide whatever was needed. Most recently, TC's donated food for forty people at the non-profit event, "Are You the Woman at the Well?", Women's Workshop at the Beacon Center, to help motivate and encourage women who have been victims of domestic violence and abuse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To satisfy her desire to make an impact on the lives of young people while running the restaurant (instead of teaching), Sharon used every opportunity to mentor dozens of young people who she lovingly referred to as her daughters, little sisters or her little cousins. Consistent with her generous and caring spirit, she cared for her biological mother Lorraine, and her father, TC, until her death in 2008 and his death in 2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of Sharon's favorite past times were a good comedy show, and good Vegas show, spending time with family, and she LOVED old photographs and scrapbooking. Things that her loved ones will never forget about her include how she always lovingly exclaimed as she burst out into her infectious laughter, "You are crazy!" and "I LOVE YOU!" and how she always made every single friend, play sister/brother, and play cousin BELIEVE that YOU were indeed her FAVORITE of all!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sharon is survived by tons of nieces, nephews, cousins, and extended family members and friends who adored Sharon more than words can say. WE LOVE YOU SHARON! (and we know that she loves us back!)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;A beautiful soul was birthed on October 15, 1990 to the proud parents, Candy Smith and Terry Austin at 7:55 pm in Las Vegas, Nevada. She was the only daughter born to this union. Shortly after her birth, her mother would have to take her back to the hospital. This is when Twanique's diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy was explained. Unbeknownst to her family, "Twinkie" a nickname given to her, would show us that she may be wheelchair bound but the chair will not hold her down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Twinkie received her first wheelchair at the young age of three. During this time, Twinkie learned to ride horses to strengthen her back as Hippo Therapy so she would be able to sit up in the chair. Twinkie attended elementary school but her middle and high school years were spent at Variety School. It was here where Twinkie learned her first word "blue", how to feed herself, how to use walkers, and how to swim. They tried to giver her an ipad because she was non-verbal. However, Twinkie threw the ipad on the floor and declared, "I can talk for myself." She obtained her diploma June 11, 2009. as a Certificate of Completion. Twinkie liked a famous quote by Frederick Douglass that reads, "If there is no struggle, there is no progress". Twinkie had a physical struggle but her progress in life was phenomenal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, Twanique was taught by her mother that she could be anything, she could do anything, and go wherever her heart desired. These bits of wisdom from her loving mom would propel Twinkie to become the determined, self-willed, independent young lady we knew her to be. As a result of this, Twinkie decided she wanted to work. Twanique worked part time at Transition Services for seven (7) years and attended Nevada Adult Day Care. In 2012, Life Long Dreams assisted Twinkie in her endeavor to go to Hollywood. She met her favorite actor Kyle Massey from "That's So Raven and Cory's in the House". She would also meet "Mr. Belding" Dennis Haskins from "Saved by the Bell". He became intrigued with Twinkie's hair and began to play in it. Not to be outdone, Twinkie began to run her fingers through his hair. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In her adult life, Twinkie began to attend Tabernacle of Praise Church of God in Christ. She was adamant about her praise. She took note of how her Pastor would praise God and preach and would imitate him. Twinkie was baptized by her Pastor with a special hyssop branch. Twinkie loved God's people and always had a smile on her face.  If you got close to her, she would draw you in with her powerful, strong arms and strike up a conversation with you. Twanique never wanted for anything. God was a provider and her mother made sure she was well taken care of. Twinkie had an advocate here on earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Early Thursday morning, August 22, 2019 Twanique ascended into the arms of her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and He welcomed this beautiful soul.&lt;/div&gt;

Terrance was so animated and loving, that it was impossible to not laugh in his presence (especially when he hit the dance floor)!&lt;/div&gt;

He brightened up every room with a "prank" and his contagious smile! Everyone who came in contact with him was in love. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anden accepted Christ at an early age. Additionally, he grew up in Compton, California by way of Lancaster. Anden had a love for rapping and putting on many shows (LOL). His favorite color was green. What's funny is that he had a blanket (fleece camouflage throw) that he would wear 'acting like Superman' on many occasions!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anden resided in Las Vegas, NV, until God found cause to call him home to be with him on June 18, 2019. Although he will be truly missed by many near and far, his memories will live on forever.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sunrise: April 8, 1959     Sunset: June 26, 2019&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img src="https://le-cdn.hibuwebsites.com/8c206443bcac4e52b0246f97e1431abe/dms3rep/multi/opt/Eloise+Caldwell-1920w.PNG" alt="obit image" /&gt;
&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Eloise Caldwell was born on April 8, 1959 in Monroe, Louisiana to Luther, Jr. &amp;amp; the late Mary Lee Brothers-January. She was baptized at an early age and united with Pilgrim Baptist Church in Winnsboro, Louisiana under the leadership of the late Rev. E.G. Lumpkins. She attended Winnsboro Elementary School and Winnsboro Jr. High School and graduated from Wossman High School in Monroe, LA, Class of 1977. Then she went on to Grambling State University. At Grambling, Eloise pledged to the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and became a Delta in the spring of 1979. She moved to Las Vegas in 1982, a single mother of two daughters, whom she loved with all of her heart. She worked so hard to provide the best life possible for her family and to instill in them all of the love, Faith and strength she had within her! She joined Victory Missionary Baptist Church under the leadership of the late Rev. J.E. Richarson, Sr. and in 1992, was one of the very first members of the newly organized Tabernacle of Faith, under the leadership of Bishop Corine W. Claiborne. She remained a faithful and dedicated member of Tabernacle of Faith until she was called home. Eloise has been a faithful and dedicated choir member, praise team leader, Sunday school teacher, Vacation Bible School teacher, on the finance committee, chaired over many auxiliaries in the church, licensed Evangelist, Minister, and recently promoted to Associate Pastor. Wherever help was needed in the church, she didn't hesitate to volunteer. She was employed at the Clark County Court System for the past 24 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She married Jeffray Caldwell on July 27, 2004. They traveled around the country, driving and exploring the United States. They cooked, prepared, and catered meals together for church activities, family reunions, and other gatherings. She taught him how to really love someone, and he loved her! They would always show up at church or other events dressed alike. She was his perfect gift from God, for 15 years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eloise was a beautiful, loving, and giving person. She always had a smile that would light up the whole room. She was loved by so many that will truly miss her. Her departure from this earth has left a huge void in our hearts and our lives, but we all know that the Lord does not make mistakes. She is "Gone Too Soon" for us, but not for God. We all loved her, but God loves her more. And THAT is a lot of love...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Matthew Howard aka Punkin, P Funk was born on April 6, 1970 to Helen Howard Washington and John Levi. Matthew was educated in Las Vegas area attending Rose Warren Elementary, Garside Jr. High and graduated from Bonanza High School.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Matthew was truly a sports lover, he enjoyed playing baseball and boxing was his favorite sport, and he was known as the "One Hitter Quitter." Matthew lived life to the fullest until he surrendered his life over to the Lord, that's when his true mission began. When he fell in love with the Lord Jesus Christ, he began to be a God chaser. Matthew loved the Lord with his whole heart and told all that came into his presence about the goodness of the Lord. He was very gifted using his talents wisely. He was a self-promoter starting with his children New Day, that performed before thousands and traveled throughout our city singing at churches, schools, talent shows, and opening up different events. He exemplified one that lived a regenerated life as he pursued souls for the Kingdom of god. He was truly a soul winner. His soul winning started in his home first teaching the word of God and literally having full service with his wife, children, nieces, and nephews. Matthew was not a perfect man but he served a perfecting God in which he trusted to known God would work out all things for his good if he continued to trust him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For those who truly knew him, he had a word he used constantly; perspective. We may not follow everything according to his perspective, but his legacy he lived and leaves behind if all would view his perspective; which was to believe in Jesus Christ and except Christ into your life, as your Lord and Savior, and know you will be saved from you sins, we will all see him again. Matthew fought a good fight and he finished his course. Today we declare Matthew's mission accomplished.&lt;/div&gt;

She was modestly content in the most eloquent way, and content with the simple things of life, even though she was worthy of the best and royalty. Her selfless spirit never looked for recognition of praise, and never gave personal her opinion, even when asked - She always gave you the word of God nothing more and nothing less. And whatever God and the said...it was So.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandra enjoyed attending school and playing sports at Westside and Madison elementary, Roy Martin Middle School and later graduated from Clark high School in 1971.

After the ten years were up, God lead her back into the work field with CCSD to continue her purpose of working with children, mainly special needs, and behavioral challenged children. While working in the School district, she would walk the hallways and fields every day and every break praying, she would even anoint and lay hands on the children, praying and casting bad spirits and behavior from the kids and she did this all in love and along the way She gain much love and respect, as as fostering many wonderful friendships and beautiful bonds. Sandra gave willingly and unselfishly and in return was loved and respected to the utmost by all who knew her. She retired for CCSD after serving her purpose for 25 years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of Sandra's greatest joys in life were first and foremost faithfully serving God, praying, teaching and ministering the word of God, her family, cooking, arts and crafts, and drinking "Pepsi". Back in the day, her home was always open to the neighborhood children, as she was known as the neighborhood candy lady, and the hot tamale lady. Her love for her family and people were magnified beyond life. Sandra best and most admiring qualities she was a faithful, praying woman of God, always ready and willing to minister and pray for anyone and everyone. She was a beautiful, nurturing mother, grandmother, sister, and friend. She was an amazing cook, loving to cook for her family for every occasion, especially the holidays, where she would stay up all night preparing the holiday feast - as she loved her family and the holidays, she'd cater for parties and even small restaurants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She will be best remember by her calm demeanor, her patients, her ever-lasting love and kindness, felt by everyone who came into her presence. She never allowed anyone else's high strung or stressful energy or emotions affect her calmness or peace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While you were here on earth you were already an angel that beheld peace - So we won't say Rest in Peace, but yet Enjoy your new home and family in Heaven. We greatly love you and will miss you until we take our last breath. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Joycelyn Toney Chaney, affectionately called 'Joyce" was born on October 4, 1935 in Pioneer, LA to the parentage of Bessie and Theodore Toney, Sr. She was the fourth of six children from this union. Her siblings, Sammie, Milma, Theodore, Jr., Leroy and Sherman all preceded her in death. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Toney family relocated from Pioneer, LA to Las Vegas, NV in the 1940's, where Joyce remained an enduring resident. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She accepted Christ as her Lord and Savior and participated in church activities at an early age. She joined Pilgrim Rest Missionary Baptist Church under the direction of Rev. E.C. Kline. Later she became a member of Mountaintop Faith Ministries under guidance of Rev. Clinton House. She was very actively involved in the culinary ministry while serving there. She returned to Pilgrim Rest, and at the tie of her demise, she was actively under the leadership of Rev. McKinley Hardman Jr,. where she was a member of the Hospitality Committee. During her time at Pilgrim Rest, she worked  in various capacities throughout the church.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joyce began her formal education in the Louisiana Public School System and continued in the Clark County Public School System when her family relocated to Las Vegas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She always enjoyed cooking and working with food. In fact, her culinary career began at age 14, when her father shook her awake one morning and announced, "Baby, I'm going to teach you how to make bread today." From that point on, she further honed her cooking skills at virtually at every hotel kitchen in Las Vegas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joycelyn Toney met Lonnie Chaney in Las Vegas, NV and they were married on February 15, 1962. A beautiful blended family was created through this union to include their children. Alexander (Alex), Della Denise, Lonnie Jr.,  Linda, Lona and Sandra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joyce displayed an entrepreneurial spirit, determined to be her own boss and make a difference! She left a comfortable job in culinary occupation to open her first venture, "The Chat N Chew." From the she owned and operated several other diners/cafes/businesses in and around Las Vegas including: Chaney's Lake Mead Hickory Pit, Sunrise Jiffy Market. Park 2000, C's Cotton Club, Sophisticated Lady Hair and Nails (which she obtained for her daughter, Della Denise); and Sunrise Travel Club/Westside Charter Service. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joyce loved her family. she enjoyed spending time with them. and they FELT THE SAME about her. It seemed they got enough of each other. You could always find some family member at their house spending time with Joyce on any given day. Her daughter, Denise, refers to her mom as her "Road Dog!' She often says that the roles were reversed when it came to driving. Denise was "Miss Daisy" and Joyce was the chauffeur, as Joyce did most of the driving during travel around town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She enjoyed people and especially young people. She was referred to as "Mama," by her children and grandchildren's friends. Everyone was welcome at her home. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To demonstrate her love and dedication to young people, she sponsored the Sunrise Travel Club and the Womack Sophisticated Ladies Drill Teams. These were award-winning drill teams that were involved in various community events. Largely due to her support, they were able to travel and participate throughout the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Joyce will be remembered as a strong woman: ambitious, kind nurturing and full of compassion. She was such a giving person, who gave and opened her doors to many, including less fortunate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the early evening of February 12, 2019, God saw fit in His wisdom to call Joycelyn Toney Chaney home to be with Him. Awaiting and rejoicing to see her son, Lonnie Jr.,  who departed this life on January 16, 2016 and her  great grandson, Donald Troutman, Jr., To God be the glory!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;To my Family, Friends this story is written by Estella V. Terry on one Saturday morning at 7:30 am. "Poope you will have to have any sisters help finish this because I am too full. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Estella V. The Child &lt;/b&gt;grew up on 3543 So. Prairie Ave. alongside the Howard Family and loving aunts, uncles and cousins. Estella had a deep love of Jesus Christ because Dollie &amp;amp; Willie kept all their children close t o their savior Jesus Christ. At the age of 9yrs old Estella was baptized under the leadership of Reverend William Bailey Sr. she joined the First Gideon Baptist Church in  Chicago, IL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella V. The Student &lt;/b&gt;attended Raymond Grammar School of Windells Phillips High School. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella V. The Young Woman &lt;/b&gt;met Johnnye Jr. Henry D, Terry's brother who introduced the two. Henry and Estella both hit off. Estella went to the show with the brothers to see a John Wayne movie. The name of the movie was "the High and Mighty" and John Wayne made a personal appearance.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Afterword, the dating continued, quick trips to Jew town to eat delicious polishes and pork sandwiches. Henry and Estella would attend weekend card games at the Uncle Calvin's house and the Ross's fell in love with Estella. Their special courtship led to marriage in 1955. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella V. The Wife &lt;/b&gt;and husband moved to 79th and Eberhart and lived with  her sister and brother in law, Monroe and Ida Jackson. In 1958, Ida Mae and Estella were both pregnant at the same times. Estella and Henry's only child Henry D. Terry Jr. was born on September 22, 1958. Dollie Mae named Henry Poope, however, his grandfather called him Purch, his grandmother called him Poochie Boy and Stella affectionately called him Poope. This special only child was loved everyday of his life and his mother dressed him in the finest of clothes that money could buy.  Estella wrapped her child in unconditional remarkable love. Which resonated and developed one of the most loving men God has working for him on earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The  best Cooks out of them Howard girls was Willa Mae &amp;amp; Estella V. The best pound cakes, salmon croquet's, deep fried shrimps, greens extraordinaire, cabbage, chicken, string beans and cornbread. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella The Worker &lt;/b&gt;Estella started working at the age of 16 years old and didn't stop until her retirement. She first worked as a supervisor for four years at Neisners 5 &amp;amp; 10 store located at 47th Calumet. Then Western Electric for 9 years. Estella worked two jobs at many intervals in her career. Estella worked at the United States Postal Worker and for the Chicago Police Department as a dispatcher for many years. Finally, Estella decided to take care of children by running The Burn Unit at Cook County Hospital until retirement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella V. The Mother &lt;/b&gt;cared for her beloved son. As a child I was very sick and practically no immune system as a result of Asthma. My mother carried me to hospitals back and forth for many years, one day at a time. I remember numerous trips to  Dr. Thomkins office on 63rd and Marylands and then 75th and Dr, Martin Luther King Drive. Then we would go to Barbara Jeans and Madison  House to enjoy the family times with my cousin Alicia. Or we would take 76th street to Lucy and Freddie's house, we would even stop by Mr. and Mrs. Jacksons house because we had family all over the south side of Chicago. My mother would drive me to Evergreen Plaza where the owner of Mr. Lees Men's Clothing s would fit me into tailor made suites from the ages of eight years old until I was a teenager. My mother introduce me into the Drive In Theatre on 74th Street behind Zayres. My mother taught me manners. My mother paid for a private school  at Sacred Heart for eight years. My mother taught me along with my Grandmother Dollie and Willie the responsibility it was to live in the Big House at 6839 Aberdeen. we were the second Black Family on the block. My memories of my Mother are inundated with Love, Block Parties, twenty trips to OK's Store across the street, The BEST Neighbor Experience a child or teenager could imagine. My Mother saved lives sitting in her second floor window watching ,praying, and shouting out the window to Alonzo, Bobby, Robert Lee, The Reeds, The Langrones, Mary Myrick, the Humphries and on and on. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estella The Grandmother &lt;/b&gt;Estella was the grandma of four. Tryrell Michael, Ryan Leslie, Katelynn Virginia and Henry David III whom she loved dearly. Her joy and happiness gleamed as a result of her grandchildren. No mother loved their children as hard as she loved me. Her health challenge never removed her memory of the four wonderful grandchildren of hers. My mother went to higher level of appreciation when she became a great grandmother to Zaryon, Tryell Jr. (Butterball). Zachary, Zara and out latest addition Zeda. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;﻿Henry The son &amp;amp; Caretaker &lt;/b&gt;﻿Message to every son who has the privilege of taking care of your mother in the winter of their life. Your reasonable service is to c are, feed, hug, embrace, spend quality time, and supply any need your mother may have. I want every ear that can hear and every eye that can see to know that my wife never complained, refused, or measured what I did or spent on my mother's needs. I supplemented myself to her well being because I had found my niche in life and my family was comfortable with my compromise. My mother for 60 years was the attached angel, confidant, precious friend and grandmother to my children. Mother to my very soul that God created because she was wonderfully made in His image is very reason our hearts connected so. The maker of the heart is God Shella and Poope are separated for a minute, her heart needs to be with her maker alongside the two hearts she missed the most....Dollie and Willie! See YA! Poochie Man &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

They graciously agreed to love and raise them as their own and as a bonus there were blessed with the baby sister, Clara. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Galean grew older, he and Darryl developed a close father-son bond. As a teenager, Galean had some challenges in school ad started goofing off in class, but always realized the importance of education. He enjoyed family gatherings with his cousins and was always the BIG protector of all his female cousins. His love for sports continued gravitating towards basketball and boxing, but also started to have some interest in music. Noticing Galean's interest in music, his aunt and uncle allowed him to have a music studio in their home, and began nurturing his passion for music into a career. With Galean's lively and magnetic personality, people were automatically drawn to him, so his aunt and uncle began adopting all of his friends into their ever-expanding family. At the age of 19, Galean graduated from Desert Winds High School, Lancaster in 1999.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fresh out of high school Galean begin following his uncle Darryl's food steps and begin assisted him with cooking and catering jobs. While catering, he discovered club promoting and started to learn the promotion business within the club scene. In this platform, he had the opportunity to perform his music that he loved so much. Being a large man he found it had its perks as well and occasionally worked as a club bouncer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Navigating between different career interest, Galean was never truly happy in California, so in his early 2000's he moved to Las Vegas his uncle Herbert and aunt Pam lived. He quickly found work in the club scene as a bouncer while still promoting, performing, and his passion in the music industry. Galean's life would still take another turn when he met the love of his life, Andrea Patterson, in July 2012. As their relationship grew he proposed on St. Patrick's Day 2014 and called his sisters and mother to announce he had fallen in love and would be marrying Andrea. He brought her home that Christmas 2014 along with her son, Damariyae, to meet the family. They were married on May 23rd 2015. As Galean and Andrea began to build a life together, his relationship with Damariyae also flourished into a father-son bond with plans to expand their little family with the new addition to the family. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Galean had recently joined the construction crew as a cement worker at the new Raiders Stadium and was looking forward to being a part of his monumental opportunity . unfortunately,,on December 05, 2018 Galean's life was senselessly taken during an altercation attempting to protect his family. We will always remember Galean R Simon as a loving husband, dedicated father, beloved brother, son and uncle. In our hearts he always by our Superman and always out Hero! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Parents Nina Davie &amp;amp; Guy Lee Banks Jr. were completely overjoyed when their first child Guy Lee Banks III was born on April 3, 1993 at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was the sweetest and cutest little boy. He loved to play with his toys, and especially his cars! he never traveled anywhere without at least without at least one Hot Wheel. He could play "cars" for hours alone or with company. When he was just an infant he was affectionately given the nick name "Guy Guy" by his cousin which his family and close friends call him to this day. Anyone who knew Guy Guy would say how polite,  well mannered, and quiet he was. One of his proudest life experiences was definitely being a GREAT big brother and having a loving relationship with his younger siblings: Jalon, Ayi, Keion, Rylie, Gianna, and Kiyori. He spoiled his sisters so much that he wouldn't allow Rylie to go upstairs without him carrying her although she could walk on her own. He would tuck her in at night, attend all of her extra curricular activities and help his parents with keeping all of them safe and happy. Although he and his brother Jalon fought occasionally, they always threw in the towel to spend countless hours playing video games together. Guy loved to listen to music too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guy Guy loved sports, during his childhood he participated in many extra curricular activities such as baseball and football. He enjoyed playing basketball with his Dad, uncles, cousins, and friends. His favorite sports teams were the Green Bay packers and the LA Lakers. He loved to watch the Green Bay Packers while playing dominoes at his aunt Angie's home with her and his uncle as they are also big fans. Since a young boy he aspired to play baseball and was looking to participate in a local team before his demise. Guy Guy always fought hard to do well in Elementary School, Junior High and High School was no different. He graduated from Desert Pines High School in the Spring of 2018. He spoke of how happy he was that his family from both sides were there to celebrate him during his graduation. He worked hard to become independent and he loved kids so he gained employment at the Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club during and after graduating high school, before taking on two jobs at UPS and Republic Services that he was employed at the time of his demise. His demeanor was so respected that he was even given the nickname "Uncle Guy" by the barbershop whenever he went to Leemah to keep his "fade fresh". They said he had such an old soul. He was studying for the ASVAB to join the Air Force and was an active participant in the voting process as he voted early last week. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Anyone who knew or met Guy Guy would surely tell you these same words: "he was always a happy person, his smile was contagious, and little shy, considerate and kind" - almost to a fault. Naturally, he made friends and had the same group of friends since childhood. He loved hanging out with his aunts, uncles and cousins. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His aunt laughed about how he was so excited to have a car, that he popped up with two of his closest friends to hang out with his "TT Toya and Uncle Rick". She bragged about how happy she was to hang out with them and how special she felt that the boys enjoyed their company (or the food), so much that they were pushing back the time to hang out with their girlfriends that day. Since a baby, napping was his favorite past time. He would nap whenever he could even while riding from one end of town to the next!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Guy Guy was 19 at the age of his passing. &lt;/div&gt;

As she would always say. "When You Hear of My Homegoing, Don't Worry About Me" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;﻿Verlene attended public school by way of Carthage High School in Arkansas where she graduated. After leaving Fordyce, AK, Verlene relocated to Las Vegas in the Year of 1962, where she immediately started a family and was extremely excited to be a Proud Mother of 11 (Eleven Children). With her "Ultra-Determined" attitude, she fiercely sought employment. Her first jobs were at the Landmark Hotel and Caesars Palace. After leaving Caesars Palace she joined the Nevada Test Site and tirelessly worked there until she retired in 1995.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;﻿Everyone and anyone who crossed her path knew her as a &lt;b&gt;"Tell It Like It Is Woman", &lt;/b&gt;﻿leaving no stones unturned. Additionally, she was a caring person who truly Loved The Lord and most of all her unwavering commitment to the Church. Her children was her proudest accomplishments who she doted on and loved dearly. She will be remembered for her canny sense of humor, flawless love of wearing fashionable clothes as well as hats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;﻿God found cause to call Verlene Home to be with him on November 10, 2018, as she transitioned peacefully at her home. Although she will be truly missed by many near and far, her memories  will live on forever.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="inner-paragraph" data-blog-inner="text"&gt;Marie Bolden, daughter of the late Reverend Nathaniel Bolden Sr. and Emma Richard Bolden, was born on July 15, 1936, in Mound, Louisiana. Marie was affectionately known to her family and friends as "Baby Sister" or "Bay Sue." Marie spent the majority of her childhood in Louisiana and later moved to Nevada as a teenager. Marie was a proud graduate of Basic High School in Henderson, Nevada. She worked determinedly to provide for her family for nearly 30 years in the hotel industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Marie loved to spend time caring for her family and selflessly took on the role as the family's matriarch. Marie had a strong passion for writing poems. She chronicled history, tackled topics of love and companionship, and proclaimed her faith in God through her poetry. In her free time, Marie enjoyed spending time with her grandchildren, cooking, sewing, listening to music, and collecting coins. In her youth, she loved to go to concerts and dances. As a result of her comforting spirit and welcoming personality, she was loved by many family and friends. Marie solemnly left this life on July 27, 2018.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;![endif]--&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt; &lt;p&gt;Francisco H. Cooper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Aka Kiko, Cisco, Frank, Cooper and
Coop, was a loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle companion and friend. He
began his journey into this world on January 27, 1952 born in New York. In
1959, his parents moved to Groesbeck Texas where he attended and graduated from
high school. Following graduation Francisco joined the Army and served his
country four years. His military career brought him to San Diego California.
Although he held several jobs following his military tenure, in October 1984
Francisco joined the United States Postal Service and there he remained until
his retirement in 2013. After retiring from the postal service with close to
thirty years of service, Francisco transitioned to Las Vegas Nevada to be
closer to family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Francisco had an infectious smile.
His attractive demeanor, charm and tall stature was that of royalty. Most of
all, his joyous laughter left an imprint in our hearts and memories of good
times shared Whether watching Star Trek, a sporting event, gambling at the
casino or eating out (especially brunch), he savored every moment with family
and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From Kiko with the biggest afro, to
Cisco with the suave walk, or Frank the hardest working postal employee (never
called in sick) – you were blessed to know him. In every aspect of his life,
Francisco took pride in all that he did. He was the best gift wrapper (every
seam even when packaging Christmas gifts) and he could put ANYTHING together (toys,
bikes, home fixtures – you name it). His only flaws – yes, he had them – would be
burning the meat during BBQ’s and procrastination. Francisco is known for being
firm about not submitting income tax forms until the last hour – especially if
he had to pay Uncle Sam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Gone to soon, Francisco departed our
life on July 18, 2018. We all loved him, but God loved him more. May he rest in
peace under the tender care of our Heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Left behind to cherish his memories
are his four memories, Eboni, Matthew (Rosie), Kecia (Cedric) and Rickey
(Stormie), his friend Nenita &amp;amp; family, seven grandchildren. Two brothers
William Maldonado (deceased) &amp;amp; Mario Maldonado (deceased). Five sisters
Liduvina Jones (Dwain), Cuizelle Council Shannon (Robbie Shannon deceased),
Yolanda Redic, Hermelinda Diaz Cooper, and a host of nieces, nephews and
friends.&lt;/p&gt;
